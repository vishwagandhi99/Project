# Project
This is a python project on web_scrapping

I have crawled Amazon books in here. There is a conversion file in the folder and by running that file the data will automatically be saved in MySQL Database and generate an excel file of the same.

While running if any error occurs due to CSS selectors then it is because a huge brand like amazon changes its css time to time. Currently its working great. Also due to COVID-19 situation Amazon have disabled its services, so some components of the product details are not visible which can give null data.

So to repent it I have created another project(Scrapping) with a bit of variance. I’ve used GUI in here and have scraped a quotes website. I’ve used pipelines to store data in database.

I suggest viewing amazon scrapper first and then quotes scrapper(Scrapping folder).
